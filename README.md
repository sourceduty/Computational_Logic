[Computational Logic](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-JTuo4xfRG-computational-logic) was developed to assist users in programming and simulating computational logic circuits using Python. It helps users understand and implement various digital logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and more. The GPT provides clear, concise code examples to simulate these gates, while also explaining basic concepts related to digital logic as needed. It can guide users through creating more complex circuits, such as multiplexers or flip-flops, and assist with debugging or troubleshooting related Python code or simulations.

In addition to the practical code support, the GPT offers a step-by-step approach to guide users through the process of designing and simulating logic-based systems. This means it asks multiple-choice questions to help clarify user goals and direct them toward the appropriate solution. While the focus is on Python implementations, the GPT can also explain more advanced concepts upon request, tailoring responses to the user's needs without getting too deep into theoretical discussions unless specifically asked.
